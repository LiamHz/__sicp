## Notes
Recursive processes are characterized by a chain of deferred operations.

Iterative processes are characterized by by being able to capture its state with a fixed number of variables.

Recursive processes are different from recursive procedures.
- The recursiveness of a process details how the size of the process evolves
- The recursiveness of a procedures details whether the procedure refers to itself

Tail recursion: A recursive procedure with an iterative process.

Tree Recursion: A recursive process where each stage causes multiple branching recursive calls. Number of steps required is proportional to the number of nodes in the tree, while the space required is proportional to the maximum depth of the tree.

Tree recursive processes are often easy to specify and implement, but computationally inefficient.

Orders of growth give a crude description of the behavior of a process. A process requiring $1000n^2$ steps and a process requiring $3n^2+10n+17$ steps all are O(n^2)

Order of growth is useful to roughly understand how the behavior of the process will change as the input grows.

## Exercises
### Exercise 1.9: Iterative and Recursive Processes
_Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures `inc`, which increments its argument by 1, and `dec`, which decrements its argument by 1._

_Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating `(+ 4 5)`. Are these processes iterative or recursive?_

```scheme
; Procedure 1
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) 
      b 
      (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

; (+ 4 5)
; (inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
; (inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
; (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
; (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
; (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
; (inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
; (inc (inc (inc 6)))
; (inc (inc 7))
; (inc 8)
; 9

; Procedure 2
(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0) 
      b 
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

; (+ 4 5)
; (+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
; (+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
; (+ (dec 2) (inc 7))
; (+ (dec 1) (inc 8))
; (+ 0 9)
; 9
```

As can be seen by how the call stacks change, procedure 1 uses a recursive process, while procedure 2 uses an iterative process.

### Exercise 1.10: Ackermann's Function
_The following procedure computes a mathematical function called Ackermann's function._

```scheme
(define (A x y)
  (cond ((= y 0) 0)
        ((= x 0) (* 2 y))
        ((= y 1) 2)
        (else (A (- x 1)
                 (A x (- y 1))))))
```

_[Part 1]: What are the values of the following expressions?_

```scheme

(A 2 4)  ; 
; (A 1 (A 2 3))
; (A 1 (A 1 (A 2 2)))
; (A 1 (A 1 (A 1 (A 1 1))))
; (A 1 (A 1 (A 1 2)))
; (A 1 (A 1 4))
; (A 1 16)
; 2^16
; 65536

(A 3 3)
; (A 2 (A 3 2))
; (A 2 (A 2 (A 3 1)))
; (A 2 (A 2 2)))
; (A 2 4)
; 65536
```

```scheme
(define (f n) (A 0 n))  ; 2*n
(define (g n) (A 1 n))  ; 2^n
(define (h n) (A 2 n))  ; 2^2 n times
```

### Exercise 1.11: Iterative and Tree Recursive Processes
_A function $f$ is defined by the rule that $f(n)=n$ if $n<3$ and $f(n)=f(n−1)+2f(n−2)+3f(n−3)$ if $n≥3$._

_Write a procedure that computes $f$ by means of a recursive process. Write a procedure that computes $f$ by means of an iterative process._

```scheme
; Tree recursive
(define (f n) 
  (if (< n 3)
      n
      (+ (f (- n 1))
         (* 2 (f (- n 2)))
         (* 3 (f (- n 3)))
      )
  )
)

(f 4)
(f 5)

; TODO Implement the iterative procedure
```

### Exercise 1.12: Recursive Pascal's Triangle
_The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal's triangle._

```scheme
1
1 1
1 2 1
1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
```

_The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it. Write a procedure that computes elements of Pascal’s triangle by means of a recursive process._

```scheme
(define (pascal x y)
  (if (or (= x 1) (= x y) (= y 1))
      1
      (+ (pascal (- x 1) (- y 1)) (pascal x (- y 1)))
  )
)

(pascal 2 4)
(pascal 2 5)
(pascal 3 5)
```

### Exercise 1.13: Induction and Recursive Fibonacci
_Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to $\phi^n/\sqrt{5}$, where $\phi=(1 + \sqrt{5})/2$._

_Hint: Let $\psi=(1 − \sqrt{5})/2$. Use induction and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers to prove that $Fib(n)=(\phi^n−\psi^n)/\sqrt{5}$_

**TODO:** Review induction and complete this question.

### Exercise 1.14: Orders of Growth for Count Change
_Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the count-change procedure of 1.2.2 in making change for 11 cents. What are the orders of growth of the space and number of steps used by this process as the amount to be changed increases?_

**NOTE:** Process tree isn't worth the time to draw.

**Order of Growth - Space:** Space required is equivalent to the maximum depth of the tree, which is equal to the number of times the smallest coin divides the amount.

**Order of Growth - Number of Steps:** Steps required is equivalent to the number of nodes in the tree, which is approximately $n^k$, where $n$ is the number of different types of change, and $k$ is the maximum depth.

### Exercise 1.15: Order of Growth of sin Procedure
_The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation $sin(x) \approx x$ if $x$ is sufficiently small, and the trigonometric identity below to reduce the size of the argument of sin (magnitude less than 0.1 radians)_

$sin(x) = 3sin(x/3) − 4sin^3(x/3)$

_This is implemented in the following procedures:_

```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
   (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
       angle
       (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))
```

_How many times is the procedure p applied when `(sine 12.15)` is evaluated?_

$x = nEvals(12.15)$

$12.15 / 3^x \lt 0.1$

$121.5 \lt 3^x$

$log_3(121.5) \lt x$

$x \gt 4.365$

$x = \lceil 4.365 \rceil$

$x = 5$

$nEvals(12.15) = 5$

_What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when `(sine a)` is evaluated?_

**Order of Growth - Space:** $\Theta(1)$ - since the sine function is tail-recursive

**Order of Growth - Number of Steps:** $\Theta(log_3 n)$
